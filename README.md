Conclusion : 

Stock up on the Doritos brand as it is more popular.
Big package sizes have more sales, we should increase production of bigger packages.
Mid-age singles or couples buy more chips, we should target this life stage in advertisements.
Most of the sale comes from the Mainstream type of customer.
